Can you visualise a world where horizontal is impossible? You are forever falling or attached to verticals? What if your tummy rumbling created earthquakes? In a world where food is rare. What if NPC's could load and save your game? You have to keep on their side otherwise they won't save your game, load old saves etc. Turn based 1 on 1 fighting game. Have to level up individual bones and set which order the joints are moved and rotated to create attacks. What if bullet time existed during moments such as your child dropping an ice cream, you have to leap and stop it spoiling your nice carpet? What if your 99 year old grandfather was a key? Would you force him to travel across the world just to open a secret door? Imagine carrying a radioactive baby in a pitch black environment, your baby would act as a torch. Rocking the baby intensifies the glow etc. Game where it's Xmas everyday and you can use your presents every night to progress further into a reoccurring dream. Imagine if your player avatar feared you? became anxious if you press the buttons too hard and fast etc? A game where if you touch the floor you die. The only way to progress is to kill enemies and use their bodies as platforms. You play a babysitter, you turn up and the baby is made of cardboard. Would you stay? I want games to start asking more ethical questions. Game in which you must comfort children on a plane who are afraid of flying, game mechanic is similar to spinning plates. Imagine if you had to secretly support your family via complex ventilation passages in your large industrial home? Imagine a game in which you have to join protests to make changes to the rules within the game's world. Imagine an endless survival horror game where you gain coins to spend on creative scares when sneaking into your friend's game. Game where you control a full stop. Enemies read you stories you and you have to jump in between words at the right time. 3D adventure game where you have amnesia and wake up in a gigantic museum where every room is devoted to a year of your life. My first mobile game will be free but if you pay a little then the NPC's will be extra nice and complement you more while playing. You are a Pigeon who must go around the city trying to persuade business men not to jump off buildings by retrieving items from their home. Imagine if paying bills were to be incorporated into an online videogame. Imagine if in new Guitar Hero you play as a busker, you witness your city evolve as your music changes the decisions of people around you. Imagine if you are shot in the chest and end up in hospital. Then the enemy who shot you visits with flowers. Imagine if enemies had tatoo passwords for doors/upgrades? You have to get close to see, harder enemies have smaller more discreet tatoos. Imagine playing the only coin in the world and you're being used to decide on outcomes for all global debates. You play a hole, you must move around an environment making certain elements fall into correct targets at the right time. You are a postman with x ray eyes. Do you post that nasty letter? Do you add extra money in that little boy's birthday card? What if you could plant seeds that grow into cover systems? Try to imagine a game in which you have an imaginary friend who doesn't believe you are real, you must convince them that you are. Imagine walking past a mirror in a game that reflects the same surrounding area but from somebody else's game? You are a bin, by day people are throwing litter in you but by night you use that litter to highlight issues in the city through modern art. You play a father whose family dog has gone missing. You die looking for it and return home in the body of the missing dog. Romantic parkour game in which you and the love of your life must hold hands and jump around a city evading death and injury. Game in which you control a waterfall and must travel the world hiding outdoor passages from adventurers. You are a small girl flying a talking kite. The kite seems to know about a upcoming major terrorist attack and floats towards clues. What if you played a game where the enemies had their children chained to them? You have to bake your enemies correctly before feeding them to your master. The oven? Only accessible during the 'game over' screen. Why do games still have maps? What if instead of moving around the world the world moved around YOU? Imagine a constant rumble in a pad throughout the game,your heartbeat. Then at the end, you die and it just stops. Physical emotion. Imagine controlling a tear, similar to flower but instead of fields you navigate a naked body. You control a mystical rabbit at a bus stop during Winter. You must find as many creative ways as possible to make people miss their buses. 4 player online co-op where one person is the hero who can only see friend's kinect skeletons which they motion to guide the hero through. What if you rode a horse that knew the solution to every puzzle? Could you still ride the horse knowing that you can't communicate with it? Painting your memories onto the environment, not sure how it works yet but the idea is quite beautiful. Game in which you can use your power meter as a bridge, to make bridge reach fit bigger gaps you need to build up your power meter. A game in which you and your father's face is a portal. You're on Earth, he is in Space. You must pass each other items to get back together. You awake in a 88 floor skyscraper all alone. Every floor is haunted by one of 88 innocent people you killed during an illegal war. Boss that also has a ghost. Must play spot the difference to find weak spots. Ghost only has 7 eyes? shoot that 8th eye on the boss etc. I designed a point and click adventure many years ago where you had to gain the trust of the pointer so it didn't lie to you.
